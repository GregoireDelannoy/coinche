# Coinche

Careful ! Weekend/lockdown code.

Implements partially the french card game "coinche", or "contr√©e". The goal is not to do everything on the website, you still need to communicate with the other players with a chat/voice program.
The game is not localized.

To run : `npm install express deepcopy socket.io && node app.js`
